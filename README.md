NLP-Based Real Estate Search Platform
👋 Project Overview

This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to search for real estate properties using natural language queries. It converts spoken or typed input into structured constraints and returns results that match multiple conditions accurately. The platform integrates AI/NLP, mapping APIs, and database filtering to provide a user-friendly and intelligent property search experience.

💻 Features

Natural Language Search: Users can type or speak queries like “3-bedroom apartments near schools with parking” and receive accurate results.

AI/NLP Processing: Extracts constraints (location, bedrooms, amenities, distances) from natural language input.

Distance Calculation: Integrates Google Maps and other APIs to filter properties based on proximity to nearby facilities (schools, hospitals, shopping centers).

Full-Stack Implementation: Frontend in React.js/Next.js, backend in Node.js/Express, database in MySQL.

Responsive Design: User-friendly interface optimized for desktop and mobile devices.

Deployment: Frontend hosted on Vercel; backend and database hosted on Railway.

🛠 Technologies Used

Frontend: React.js, Next.js, HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, RESTful APIs

Database: MySQL

APIs: Google Maps, Geocoding, Distance Calculation

AI/NLP: Natural language processing to extract structured search constraints

Version Control & Collaboration: Git, GitHub

Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Railway (backend & database)
